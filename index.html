    <h1 id="line">RAHUL GANDHI</h1>
    <div id="selection">

        <p>As the country approaches the 2024 General Elections, one leader who could be seen as one of the biggest
            challenges to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reign is Rahul Gandhi. Rahul's growing popularity was recently
            witnessed when he undertook a five-month-long Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. The foot march,
            which was launched with an eye to revive the grand old party's flagging fortunes, covered 3,570 km and
            crossed 12 states and two Union Territories. During the march, the Indian National Congress won state
            assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh and an emphatic victory in Karnataka four months after the march.
        <p> Rahul was also at the centre stage when he got disqualified as a member of the Lok Sabha on March 24, 2023
            after a Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court in Gujarat’s Surat convicted and sentenced him for two-year
            imprisonment on charges of criminal defamation for comments he made about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
            surname. Before his disqualification as an MP, Rahul was critical of the ruling government in the parliament
            and raised his voice against PM Modi's alleged soft corner towards business tycoon Gautam Adani</p>
        </p>
        <p> Soon after his disqualification, Rahul said, “Democracy is finished in this country. The people of the
            country cannot speak what is on their mind and the institutions are under attack. The mechanism of that
            attack is the relationship between Narendra Modi and Adani. That is the foundation.” Rahul echoed his 2019
            chowkidar-chor-hai line and blended it with his refrain on democratic backsliding that was a refrain in his
            speeches in the UK. ,<br>
            <br>

            The former didn’t have much of an echo then and how resonant will a refresh of that be is anybody’s guess.
            But in a pre-election year, he made it clear that his campaign against the Government — after the Bharat
            Jodo Yatra — rested on these two planks..<br>
            <br>
            Taking a cue from the success of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul has consistently been making attempts to meet
            common people on the streets, addressing young gatherings in universities and raising his voice against the
            Modi regime.
            <br>
            <br>

        </p>

    <div id="selection2">
        <p> In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul was president of the party and led the Opposition campaign. But the Grand Old Party failed miserably in the elections winning only 52 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha. Rahul lost his home turf Amethi to BJP's Smriti Irani but won from Wayanad in Kerala. The son of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul had earlier appeared to be a reluctant entrant to politics like his father. He entered electoral politics in 2004. He was appointed as the party general secretary in 2007 and was elevated to vice president of the party in January 2013. He took over as the Congress president from his mother Sonia Gandhi in December 2017. Despite everything, Rahul has clearly evolved as a leader and a lot will depend on how he drives the election campaign first in four states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana) and then for the 2024 General Elections to be most likely held in May-June.</p>
